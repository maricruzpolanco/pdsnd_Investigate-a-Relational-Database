### Project Title
Investigate a Relational Database

### Description
In this project, I set up a PostgreSQL database on my local machine and loaded it to my local PostgreSQL database server (an optional part of project). I then used SQL to explore the database related to movie rentals, writing code to run queries, answering questions about it and finally creating supporting visualizations using Tableau and Excel. This was part of Udacity's Programming for Data Science with Python Nanodegree.
